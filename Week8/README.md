# Week 8 – Bank Account Simulation:

This program creates a simple BankAccount class that can make deposits, process purchases, and show the current balance.
Each transaction is saved into a text file called `transactions.txt`.

## What the program does:
- Starts the account with a balance of $0  
- Adds a starting deposit  
- Makes at least two purchases  
- Prints the final balance  
- Saves each deposit and purchase to `transactions.txt`  

## Files included:
- `bank_account.cpp` – C++ source code  
- `transactions.txt` – Transaction history saved by the program  
- `Week8.pdf` – Screenshots showing the program running  

## How to run:
1. Compile and run `bank_account.cpp`  
2. The console will display deposit, purchase, and balance actions  
3. The program automatically creates or updates `transactions.txt`
