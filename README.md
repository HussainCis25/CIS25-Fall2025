## Module 6 – Strings and Classes
This program creates an Item class with two attributes:
string name
int quantity
It includes two methods:
saveToFile() – saves the item name and quantity to a file called items.txt
loadFromFile() – reads from the file and displays the content
In main(), an Item object is created, assigned values, and both methods are called.


### Module 11 – Constructors and Destructors
This program defines a Product class with private attributes:

int id
string name
float price
The constructor initializes these values and prints "Constructor called".
The destructor prints "Destructor called" when the object is destroyed.
The method printDetails() displays the product information.
In main(), one Product object is created and printDetails() is called.







### How to Run the Programs
Compile using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, VS Code, JDoodle).
Run item.cpp to test Module 6.
Run product.cpp to test Module 11.
